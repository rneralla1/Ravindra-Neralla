# Project1: Crime Rate in Chicago with respect to Weather and Holidays

https://github.com/rneralla1/Data-Wrangling

This project involves analyzing Chicago crime data for the year 2019 with respect to weather and holidays. One of the major difficulties I found while in this project is on getting holidays data into python from website.  I could not get the required the data using web scraping, put some extra effort to learn on how to identify the required data and capture into data frame.  Chicago weather data is sourced using weather API.
It is observed from the plots that crime is more during summer months compared to winter months.  Also number of crime incidents are more on holidays compared to regular day.  As a whole, it was good learning on how to transform data using python

# Project2: Airline Safety

Core objective of the visual is to show that air travel is safer than car travel, I took six different visuals to illustrate.  Direct comparison between airline vs car fatalities, line plot is drawn with number of fatalities in airline vs automobile crash every year.  Graph clearly shows that automobile fatalities are more consistent every year with numbers upward of 30,000 whereas fatalities in airlines in the range of 500-4000.   We can see more clearly in the airline accidents and fatalities bar graph that the number has significantly decreased in the more recent years

# Project3: Predict Customer Churn

https://github.com/rneralla1/Data-Science

Customer churn is a major problem and one of the most important concern for every company. Retaining an existing customer is many times more effective than gaining new customers.  Companies usually have a greater focus on customer acquisition and keep retention as a secondary priority. However, it can cost five times more to attract a new customer than it does to retain an existing one. Increasing customer retention rates by 5% can increase profits by 25% to 95%, according to research done by Bain & Company.  Generally, people only switch to a different company only when the service is not to the level of expectation in one or the other factor when compared to competitors, more than getting attracted to the specials and offers which are offered by the other companies

Objective:
As customer churn directly effects the revenues of the companies, companies are seeking to develop means to predict potential customer to churn. Therefore, finding factors that increase customer churn is important to take necessary actions to reduce this churn and retain the customers.
