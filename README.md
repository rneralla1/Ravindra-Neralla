# Project1: Crime Rate in Chicago with respect to Weather and Holidays

https://github.com/rneralla1/Data-Wrangling

This project involves analyzing Chicago crime data for the year 2019 with respect to weather and holidays. One of the major difficulties I found while in this project is on getting holidays data into python from website.  I could not get the required the data using web scraping, put some extra effort to learn on how to identify the required data and capture into data frame.  Chicago weather data is sourced using weather API.
It is observed from the plots that crime is more during summer months compared to winter months.  Also number of crime incidents are more on holidays compared to regular day.  As a whole, it was good learning on how to transform data using python

# Project2: Airline Safety

https://github.com/rneralla1/Data-Visualization

Core objective of the visual is to show that air travel is safer than car travel, I took six different visuals to illustrate.  Direct comparison between airline vs car fatalities, line plot is drawn with number of fatalities in airline vs automobile crash every year.  Graph clearly shows that automobile fatalities are more consistent every year with numbers upward of 30,000 whereas fatalities in airlines in the range of 500-4000.   We can see more clearly in the airline accidents and fatalities bar graph that the number has significantly decreased in the more recent years
