#Project1: Crime Rate in Chicago with respect to Weather and Holidays

https://github.com/rneralla1/Data-Wrangling

This project involves analyzing Chicago crime data for the year 2019 with respect to weather and holidays. One of the major difficulties I found while in this project is on getting holidays data into python from website.  I could not get the required the data using web scraping, put some extra effort to learn on how to identify the required data and capture into data frame.  Chicago weather data is sourced using weather API.
It is observed from the plots that crime is more during summer months compared to winter months.  Also number of crime incidents are more on holidays compared to regular day.  As a whole, it was good learning on how to transform data using python
