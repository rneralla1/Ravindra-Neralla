# DSC680 Spring 2021 Portfolio Projects


# Introduction
This repository is a portfolio of DSC 680 projects for spring 2021. Portfolio consists of three projects that will done as part of the current course.  These projects would demonstrate my understanding of different machine learning techniques learned throughout the Data Science couse at Bellevue University.


# Abstract
The following areas of this repository will discuss and explain the objectives of the projects. With this in mind, it is time to talk about the parameters of the projects. Here are the parameters of each of the projects. 


• Report/White Paper

Summarize your business problem/hypothesis

Walk through your method 

5-8 Pages, 4000-8000 words. 

APA References. 

Up to 3 Illustrations @ ¼ page each. 

Up to 1 Illustration @ ½ page. 

PDF 1 Appendix 

• Presentation

Can be in PowerPoint, Prezi or any other presentation tool. You can be creative here and use other tools like blogs, dashboards, etc. but you must have audio 

Presentation should be no longer than 15 minutes – and a minimum of 10 minutes (Remember, these are going on your portfolio, the goal is to gain the attention of potential employers.) 

• Q&A

You must submit 10 potential questions you would receive in a presentation along with your answers in a PDF. 

• Jupyter Notebook or link to your GitHub with your code/dataset.



# Summary of Skills
Python is the programming language used for data analaysis and building machine learning models. AS part of this work, Pandas,Seaborn,Matplotlib are Plotly are some of the Pythons libraries used.  Data Visualization work is done using Tableau.

# Findings
Each of these projects are domain agnostic, data agnostic, and method agnostic. This means that you can pull data from any domain, analyze it using whatever method you deem worthy, and use data that already exists in any form.

## Project One
Customer churn directly affects the revenue in any of the subscription-based businesses.  Customer churn is very common in telecom industry, due to immense competition and different options available to customers. Telecom companies are developing models to predict a possible customer churn well in advance and preparing mitigation plans to retain the customer base.

## Project Two
TBD

## Project Three
TBD



# Challenges

## Project One
Data looks clean as per the initial observation, but I need to see how it goes when I deep dive more into data. As the data size is 7043, I’m not sure on how good the data distribution is and how accurate the results would be. Also, I might encounter some unforeseen errors in python, during the development.  I plan to head start early, so that I would have sufficient time in resolving the errors, if any.

# Conclusion
Work in progress... please check back after few days....

## Project One
As part of the current work, I plan to analyze the customer churn data in telecom domain.  I started this project as the customer churn is very common in different subscription-based businesses.  Each row in the dataset represents a customer, with details like gender, number of dependents and total monthly charges etc., By using these features, if we can predict a customer would churn or not would help business to identify customer likely to churn and customer retention team can contact and provide them with alternate options to retain.  Each machine learning model produces different output, with same underlying data.  So, I would like to build multiple models and pick the best performing model. Also, I’m interested in knowing the top 3 factors involved in customer churn by doing feature engineering on the dataset.
